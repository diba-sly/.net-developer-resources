# Software Engineering Resources
I try to share any kind of resources that have helped me learn more about .NET development or anything about software engineering.

Secondly, I share books and slides that have been beneficial to me in computer engineering. Some titles may not be part of a .NET developer's roadmap, but they are necessary for me to learn as part of my personal growth. Therefore, **this repository contains resources related to programming or computer engineering**.

Enjoy it!

# Types of Files
There are several types of documents that I have shared here.
- Some of them are **online free books**. If I have mistakenly shared any non-free books, please let me know so that I can edit the repository
- Some of these files are **my documentation**. Whenever something needed to be written or presented to other colleagues, I prepared them and now share them here for your reference.

## What are "my documentation" files?
As mentioned above, some of the topics covered in this repository are not included in the roadmaps. However, I found it necessary to learn them.

At our company, we have a good practice of sharing new knowledge with other teams when a team member learns something new.
I created these documents to lecture my colleagues and am sharing them here,
hoping they will be useful for someone who would like to familiarize themselves with these topics by reading these docs.
