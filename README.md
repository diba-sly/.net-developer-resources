# .net developer resources
I try to share any kind of resources that have helped me learn more about .NET development.

Firstly, roadmaps were useful for me in understanding what it takes to be a real developer. However, I created my own customized roadmap.

Secondly, I share books and slides that have been beneficial to me in computer engineering. Some titles may not be part of a .NET developer's roadmap, but they are necessary for me to learn as part of my personal growth. Therefore, **this repository contains resources related to programming or computer engineering**.

Enjoy it!
