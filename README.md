# .net developer resources
I try to share any kind of resources that helped me to know more about .net developing.

First of all roadmaps that was usefull for me to know what is real developer! But I used my custom reoadmap!

Second of all I shared any book or slides which was useful for me in computer engineering. I mean some titles are not in road map of a .net developer but in a way of life It was needed for me to learn them. So we can say **this repo contains any resource that is related to programming or computer engineering**.

Enjoy it!
